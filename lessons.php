      <h1>About Our Lessons</h1>
      <p>All our lessons are personal, one on one, lessons with just a student and teacher</p>
      <p>The lessons run for half an hour once a week, though you may do more than one lesson if you wish. We generally advise against this as it does not give the student sufficient time to practice what they have learnt in the previous lesson.</p>
      <p>Our teachers are all passionate about passing on their knowledge to their students and take great pride in seeing their students develop and achieve their musical goals.</p>
      <p> Although not compulsory, all our teachers are able to prepare students for AMEB or Rock School Exams.</p>
      <p>Students of all ages and abilites can be catered to, with lessons structured with a focues on being fun and learning what the student wants to learn.</p>
